# Functions

Functions in Go can take zero or more arguments.

To make Go code easier to read, the variable type comes *after* the variable name.

For example, the following function:

```go
func sub(x int, y int) int {
  return x-y
}
```

Accepts two integer parameters and returns another integer.

Here, `func sub(x int, y int) int` is known as the "function signature".
