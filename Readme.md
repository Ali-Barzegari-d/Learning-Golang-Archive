# Learning Golang Archive

This repository contains a collection of Go code exercises and projects that I have worked on while learning the Go programming language. The code is organized into different categories, each representing a specific concept or feature of Go.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured into various folders based on the following categories:

- **Basics**: Basic syntax, variables, data types, and simple operations.
- **Control Structures**: Examples of loops, conditionals, and switches.
- **Functions**: Code demonstrating function creation, recursion, and closures.
- **Structs and Interfaces**: Goâ€™s way of handling object-like structures and interfaces.
- **Concurrency**: Go routines, channels, and examples of concurrent programming.
- **Packages**: How to use and create packages in Go.
- **Error**: Error checking and custom error creation.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ali-Barzegari-d/Learning-Golang-Archive.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the folder of interest and explore the code.
3. Run the Go programs using:
   ```bash
   go run filename.go
   ```
4. Feel free to use, modify, and experiment with the code as you continue your journey in Go.
